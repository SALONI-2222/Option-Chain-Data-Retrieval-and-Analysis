# Option-Chain-Data-Retrieval-and-Analysis
Overview
This project is designed to retrieve options chain data for specific instruments (like NIFTY or BANKNIFTY) and analyze the highest bid or ask prices for each strike price. It also calculates the margin required and the premium earned for each option, helping in options trading analysis.

Files
main.py: The main Python script containing the following key functions:
get_option_chain_data: Fetches option chain data and filters for the highest bid price for put options or the highest ask price for call options.
calculate_margin_and_premium: Calculates the margin requirement and premium earned based on retrieved data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and guidance on using the code.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas for data handling
requests for API requests
Install the necessary libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas requests
Setup
API Access: The code uses an options trading API, such as Upstox, to retrieve data and calculate margin requirements. You’ll need an API key and access to Upstox or a similar API.

Environment Variables: For security, store your API key in an environment variable or a secure configuration file. Alternatively, replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual key.

API Endpoint URLs: Confirm the API endpoint URLs with your provider’s documentation (e.g., Upstox). Replace placeholder URLs in the code with the correct ones.

Function Details
1. get_option_chain_data
Description: This function retrieves the option chain data for a specified instrument and expiry date. It filters the highest bid price for put options or the highest ask price for call options based on the side argument.

Parameters:

instrument_name (str): The instrument’s name, e.g., "NIFTY".
expiry_date (str): Expiry date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
side (str): Option type, either "PE" for put or "CE" for call.
Returns:

A pandas.DataFrame containing columns: instrument_name, strike_price, side, and bid/ask.
Assumptions:

API responses contain strike_price, bid_price, and ask_price keys in each option item.
Example Usage:

python
Copy code
option_data = get_option_chain_data("NIFTY", "2024-11-30", "PE")
print(option_data)
2. calculate_margin_and_premium
Description: This function takes the option chain DataFrame from get_option_chain_data, calculates the margin requirement, and computes the premium earned based on each option’s bid/ask price.

Parameters:

data (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame returned by get_option_chain_data.
Returns:

A modified pd.DataFrame with additional columns margin_required and premium_earned.
Assumptions:

The API provides margin data in response to a Sell transaction type.
A placeholder lot size is used (e.g., 120). Update this to dynamically fetch the lot size if available.
Example Usage:

python
Copy code
final_data = calculate_margin_and_premium(option_data)
print(final_data)
Usage Guide
Run the script:
python
Copy code
python main.py
Example workflow:
Fetch options chain data using get_option_chain_data.
Pass the retrieved data to calculate_margin_and_premium to calculate margin and premium.
Adjustments:
Update the lot size in calculate_margin_and_premium to reflect the actual lot size per instrument.
Error Handling
Both functions should ideally handle potential issues like:

API Connection Errors: Check for API response status before processing data.
Data Missing: Handle cases where required fields (e.g., bid_price, ask_price) are missing in the response.
AI Assistance Documentation
Code Structure: AI was used to generate initial function skeletons, helping with structuring API requests and response handling.
Financial Terms: AI clarified financial terms like "margin requirement" and "premium earned".
Error Handling Guidance: Consulted AI to identify potential API error cases and approaches for handling missing data.
Testing and Validation
Sandbox Testing: Validate functions using the API’s sandbox environment, if available.
Mock Data: Run tests with mock data if real API access is unavailable or limited.
